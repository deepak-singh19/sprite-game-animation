Sprite animation is a fundamental technique used in 2D game development and interactive web applications to create fluid and dynamic animations. It involves displaying a sequence of images (sprites) in quick succession to give the illusion of motion. In this blog, we'll explore how to build a simple sprite animation using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the following set up:

A text editor for writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

An image (sprite sheet) containing the animation frames. You can create or find sprite sheets online.
